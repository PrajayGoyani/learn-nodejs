
node server.js
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8000/


This command tells Apache Bench to send 1000 requests (-n 1000) with a
concurrency level of 100 (-c 100) to the specified URL.

Observe the benchmark results, which will include information about throughput,
latency, and other performance metrics.

By following these steps, you will be able to run a benchmark test on your Node.js
server using clustering. Remember to adjust the values in the Apache Bench command
(-n and -c) to match the desired number of requests and concurrency level for your test.
Additionally, you can modify the server implementation in server.js to include more complex
routes or logic specific to your application.

Note: Use ab.exe in this folder
