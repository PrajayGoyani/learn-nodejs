 testing is an automated way of verifying the correctness of your code
 specification encourages the mindset where you are defining 'what' the software does.


 For Mocha:
    Run npm install --save-dev mocha
    Create a test script in your package.json file, like "test": "mocha"
 For Jest:
    Run npm install --save-dev jest.
    Create a test script in your package.json file, like "test": "jest"
